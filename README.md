## Java Phone Book
This application is an interactive command line app that
simulates the contacts app on a cell phone.
Using a combination of classes, the java scanner util ,
and ArrayLists,this application allows the user to preform 
all crud operations on a simulated contact list on a 
mobile phone. Its purpose was for me to learn more about ArrayLists in java.
